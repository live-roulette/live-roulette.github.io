## Features of the roulette demo

- **European roulette wheel (single zero)**  
  Realistic number order around the rim, matching a standard European casino roulette wheel.

- **Animated ball and pointer**  
  The ball spin is animated towards the winning pocket, and every result is highlighted on the wheel and on the table layout.

- **Interactive roulette betting layout**  
  Classic inside and outside bets:
  - straight numbers (0–36),
  - red / black,
  - even / odd,
  - low / high (1–18 / 19–36),
  - dozens (1st 12, 2nd 12, 3rd 12).

- **Virtual balance and statistics**  
  Demo chips only, with automatic tracking of:
  - total wagered amount,
  - profit / loss relative to the starting bankroll,
  - sample RTP (return-to-player) based on total winnings.

- **Spin history and last results**  
  A scrollable history panel plus “last results” chips so you can quickly review recent outcomes and streaks.

- **Pure front-end roulette project**  
  No backend, no external dependencies, no sign-up — just static files running as a **JavaScript roulette demo**.
